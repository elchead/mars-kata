# Mars Rover Kata

This is our solution to the kata from [here](https://katalyst.codurance.com/simple-mars-rover).
We developed it in a pair programming session to practice TDD and try out the Svelte framework.

## Play

`l` : left rotation
`r` : right rotation
`m` : move

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
